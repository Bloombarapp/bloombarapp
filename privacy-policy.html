Bloombar may also collect information posted by users on social media sites for users that have opted to connect to or otherwise link Bloombar with social media accounts including Facebook and Twitter.

(d) Information from surveys. You may have the option of completing an online survey at the Website or within the Application from time to time. Participation in surveys is completely voluntary and it is your choice whether or not you wish to disclose your personal information to us in connection with any such survey.<br><br>

                        <h4 class="service-heading" style="color: #F5A623">3. How Your Information Is Used.</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">We use the information you provide to provide the applicable Services to you, either directly or through third party service providers, as further described above in this Privacy Policy. Bloombar may also share certain aggregated data with other third parties for general marketing and demographic purposes; however, this data, when shared on an aggregated basis, does not include any of your personal identifying information. Some of our Services may be offered in conjunction with partner companies, affiliates or other companies or websites with which we work. In order for us to provide these Services to you, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with one of such entities. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these Services. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular Service.<br><br>

In addition, Bloombar may disclose account or other personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with Bloombar's rights or property, other Website or Application users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
                        <h4 class="service-heading" style="color: #F5A623">4. Altering Information You Submit.</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">(a) Deleting your information. Federal and state regulations may require that we store questions or submissions for various periods of time. In order to comply with these regulations, we may be unable to delete information from our databases.<br><br>

                        <p class="text-muted">Bloombar uses extensive and sophisticated secure technology to protect your data and transmissions between you and Bloombar. Transmission between browsers and our web server is implemented using either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology or Bloombar's proprietary mobile application that utilizes SSL-encrypted communication.

Although Bloombar has taken these reasonable and appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is delivered and disclosed only in accordance with your instructions, Bloombar cannot and does not guarantee that the personal information you provide will not be intercepted by others and decrypted.</p>
                        <h4 class="service-heading" style="color: #F5A623">Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">If we make a change to our Privacy Policy in the future that will affect how we treat your information, we will post such change at the Website and/or within the Application, and such change will be deemed to be effective 2 days from the date of such posting. In that case, your ability to opt out of the new policy will be determined by applicable laws.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">We may, in the future, sell or otherwise transfer some or all of our assets or equity to a third party.
